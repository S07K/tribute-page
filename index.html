				<b>Here's some information about the planet <strong>Mars</strong> :</b>
			</h3>
			<ul>
				<p>
					Mars was named by the ancient Romans for their god of war because its reddish color was reminiscent of blood. Other civilizations also named the planet for this attribute; for example, the Egyptians called it "Her Desher," meaning "the red one." Even today, it is frequently called the "Red Planet" because iron minerals in the Martian dirt oxidize, or rust, causing the surface to look red.

					<strong>
						Exploration
					</strong>
					<p>
						No planet beyond Earth has been studied as intensely as Mars. Recorded observations of Mars date as far back as the era of ancient Egypt over 4,000 years ago, when they charted the planet's movements in the sky. Today, a science fleet of robotic spacecraft study Mars from all angles.
						<ul>
							<li>
								Six spacecraft are in orbit at Mars. NASA's scient trio are Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, Mars Odyssey and MAVEN. ESA managed the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter and Mars Express missions. India's first Red Planet spacecraft — the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) — since 2014.
							</li>
							<li>
								Two robotic spacecraft are at work on the surface. NASA's Curiosity rover is exploring Mount Sharp in Gale Crater. NASA's InSight, a stationary lander, is probing Mars' interior from a site on a flat smooth plain called Elysium Planitia.
							</li>
							<li>
								Both NASA and ESA have plans to send new rovers to Mars in 2020.

					<strong>
						Size and Distance
					</strong>
					<p>
						With a radius of 2,106 miles (3,390 kilometers), Mars is about half the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mars would be about as big as a raspberry.
					</p>
					<p>
						From an average distance of 142 million miles (228 million kilometers), Mars is 1.5 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 13 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mars.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Structure
					</strong>
					<p>
						Mars has a dense core at its center between 930 and 1,300 miles (1,500 to 2,100 kilometers) in radius. It's made of iron, nickel and sulfur. Surrounding the core is a rocky mantle between 770 and 1,170 miles (1,240 to 1,880 kilometers) thick, and above that, a crust made of iron, magnesium, aluminum, calcium and potassium. This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Formation
					</strong>
					<p>
						When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Atmosphere
					</strong>
					<p>
						Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars' sparse atmosphere doesn't offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids and comets.
					</p>
					<p>
						The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).
					</p>
					<p>
						Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Magnetosphere
					</strong>
					<p>
						Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.​
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>
						Rings
					</strong>
					<p>
						Mars has no rings. However, in 50 million years when Phobos crashes into Mars or breaks apart, it could create a dusty ring around the Red Planet.
					</p>
				</li>

				Scientists don't expect to find living things currently thriving on Mars. Instead, they're looking for "signs of life" that existed long ago, when Mars was warmer and covered with water.</i>
